If you've been on the queer side of the internet or been in queer or trans circles before, you've likely heard of the button test. The button test is a question typically asked to gague if someone is trans. It goes as follows:
> If you could press a button that would make you a boy/girl instantly, would you press it?

Your average binary trans person would likely answer "yes". However, we* wouldn't. The reasons for this are varied across our* system, but the main ones are:
- We* have headmates (like me, Nicky) who are multigender boygirl.
- Our* genders are sometimes different.
- But most importantly, being trans is a unique experience.

Moreover, we* collectively agree that gender is a group of facets of identity that has its corresponding norms and aesthetics. It's more complicated for us\*, because we* live above society's rigid, binary definition of gender. Additionally, we* all experience it differently with differing levels of dysphoria. This means we* exhibit it differently at different times.

## Gender Dysphoria As a Diagnosis
Sometimes, I (Nicky) call myself a "fake girl". In the exclusionist's eye, this is true; however, in a queer inclusionist's philosophical sense, I'm a girl who is also a boy. And, I don't really experience dysphoria. Here's the problem with the Gender Dysphoria diagnosis: it gatekeeps people like me (Nicky) from gender-affirming care. We* are a minor (Yes, I know. Minors on the internet can't have opinions!), so our* only hope of getting HRT is through a gender dysphoria diagnosis or through DIY. Although I (Nicky) and many of my headmates don't experience---much, if any at all---gender dysphoria, we* have lied about our* new name, pronouns, and gender. Well, not exactly. We\*'ve only disclosed to most others in real life that we* are a trans woman.
