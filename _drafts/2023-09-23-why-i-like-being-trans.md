## Intro
I (Nicky) feel like I didn't do [my last article](/blog/2023/09/23/why-i-wouldn-t-press-the-button/) justice. There were a few things that I'd neglected to say, so in this article, I'll be writing in a more positive light!

## Why?
I like the experience of being trans. I've learned to embrace the quirks that come with being trans. Many different people will have different experiences with gender dysphoria, but many of us* in the Sylv system---regardless of levels of dysphoria---have come to love all of our* intricacies. It's part of learning to be proud to be queer rather than just happy.

It's often easier said than done, but the first step is to love yourself. But, you shouldn't hold yourself to unrealistic or artificial standards. For instance, wanting to *look* cis. What is *looking cis*? That's irrelevant. You don't need to have "passing cis" on your transition checklist. Just pass for yourself, because when you hold yourself to arbitrary standards that find no bearing in reality, you will never be happy. Deciding what kind of woman, man, or individual you want to be for yourself is more important than wanting to be someone else *for* someone else.

Be trans for transness sake! It may seem like there is a need to be cis, especially in a toxic environment that is unwelcoming to trans people, but you will find yourself truly free only when you remove yourself from those environments when possible. Trying to pass as completely cis is infeasible. It's doable, but maintaining a lie for so long is nigh impossible. Transphobes are not worth your time, so they should not dictate how you present yourself.
