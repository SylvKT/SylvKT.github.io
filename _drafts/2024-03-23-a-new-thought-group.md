This is something I've been thinking about for a while. I've come to the conclusion that God is dead. Nobody believes in anything worthwhile anymore. That is why, today, I bring you my newest machination: **Therianism**. Our new organization requires that its members pledge a few things.

First, one must choose to abandon the human body. You must not accept the limitations of the human body. You must froth at the mouth with hate when you see a human. Humanity is dead, but you won't be.

And, one must accept their new desired form as themself. You must make a new body for yourself by any means necessary, and you must take care of your new body. You must be willing to commit to our group, for yourself, for ourselves, for the greater being.

Finally and most importantly, you must reject **all** other faiths and hierarchies. We vehemently gainsay and deface the state, humanity, and social superiority. It is our mission---not out of retribution---to dethrone the privileged.
