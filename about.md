# About Us
We are an endogenic system composed mostly of Sylveons, and we are all otherkins, therians, and furries with varying fursonas. We enjoy programming, Minecraft modding, math, physics, linguistics, history, poetry, music, and art.

We support all good-faith queer identities (radical inclusivity), mspec lesbians/gays, and endogenic systems. We do not support transmeds (transmedicalists), sysmeds (system-medicalists), or any other form of medicalism.
